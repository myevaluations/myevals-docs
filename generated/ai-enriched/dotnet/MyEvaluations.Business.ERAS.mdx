## Overview

The ERAS module integrates with AAMC's Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS), the centralized application system used by medical residency programs across the United States. This module handles importing applicant data from ERAS, managing connection status between MyEvaluations and ERAS, tracking error codes, and supporting dual-accreditation program configurations. It contains 3 classes including a dedicated ERASManager with 5 stored procedures and an XML-to-CSV converter for data transformation.

## Key Classes

- **ERASManager**: Core manager class for ERAS integration operations. Handles data import (`AddERASData`), field mapping (`GetERASFields`), connection status management (`UpdateERASConnectionStatus`), error code retrieval (`GetERASErrorCodes`), and dual-accreditation configuration (`UpdateERASDualAccreditation`).
- **XMLToCSV**: Utility class for converting ERAS XML data feeds into CSV format, likely used for data import processing or reporting.
- **Settings**: Auto-generated application settings class storing ERAS-specific configuration (API endpoints, credentials, connection parameters).

## Patterns

- **Manager pattern (partial)**: `ERASManager` follows the Manager naming convention and uses stored procedures for data access, but does not extend a `Manager` base class. This suggests it may predate the formalized Manager/Info pattern or was built independently.
- **External data integration**: The module follows an import-oriented pattern -- pulling data from ERAS and persisting it locally via stored procedures.
- **XML data processing**: `XMLToCSV` indicates ERAS data arrives in XML format, requiring transformation before consumption.
- **Configuration-driven**: The `Settings` class suggests environment-specific ERAS configuration (likely different credentials per institution or environment).

## Notes

- ERAS integration is critical for GME (Graduate Medical Education) programs -- it is the primary channel through which residency applicants enter the system.
- The `UpdateERASDualAccreditation` procedure handles programs with dual accreditation (e.g., programs accredited by both ACGME and AOA), a common scenario in medical education.
- The **5 stored procedures** represent a focused, well-scoped integration point that should be straightforward to migrate to a NestJS service.
- `ERASManager` does not extend the `Manager` base class, which may mean it handles its own database connections differently from other managers.
- XML-to-CSV conversion suggests batch processing workflows; migration should consider whether real-time API integration is now available from ERAS.
- ERAS data handling likely involves PII (applicant names, AAMC IDs) and should maintain strict data protection controls during migration.
