It provides a wrapper around numerical analysis routines, likely used for psychometric calculations, statistical scoring, or competency benchmarking within evaluation workflows.

Serves as the entry point for statistical calculations.\n- **NAGProgram**: Represents a NAG program configuration or execution context for running specific numerical analysis routines.\n- **NagICCWarning** (extends `Exception`): Custom exception for non-fatal warnings during ICC computations (e.g., convergence warnings, boundary conditions).\n- **NagICCError** (extends `Exception`): Custom exception for fatal errors during ICC computations (e.g., invalid input, computation failures).\n\n## Patterns\n\n- **Static utility pattern**: `Nag_ICC` is a static class, providing stateless numerical computation methods. This is typical for mathematical/statistical library wrappers.\n- **Custom exception hierarchy**: Two exception classes (`NagICCWarning` and `NagICCError`) provide graduated error severity -- warnings for recoverable issues and errors for fatal computation failures.\n- **No Manager/Info pattern**: This module does not use the Manager/Info data access pattern. It is a pure computation library with no stored procedure calls.\n- **External library wrapper**: The module wraps the NAG numerical analysis library, isolating the third-party dependency from the rest of the codebase.\n\n## Notes\n\n- This module has **no stored procedure calls** and **no database interaction** -- it is a pure computation library.\n- The NAG library is a commercial numerical analysis package. Migration to NestJS would need an equivalent statistical library (e.g., `simple-statistics`, `jstat`, or a Python microservice using `scipy`).\n- ICC (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient) is a standard psychometric measure used in healthcare education to assess inter-rater reliability of evaluations.\n- The warning/error exception separation suggests computations can partially succeed with degraded results, which should be preserved in any migration.\n- As a stateless computation module, this is relatively easy to migrate or replace -- no database state or session management is involved.\n- Consider whether ICC computations could be moved to the Node.js backend or delegated to a specialized analytics service.\n\n---\n*This documentation was auto-generated from source code analysis.
