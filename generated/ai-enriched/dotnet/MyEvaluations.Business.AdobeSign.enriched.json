With 8 classes, this focused module handles OAuth/JWT authentication, token management, agreement creation, and template logging for Adobe Sign operations. It serves as the Adobe Sign counterpart to the HelloSign module, enabling institutions that use Adobe Sign to manage document signing for program agreements, contracts, and compliance documents.\n\n## Key Classes\n\n- **AdobeSignClient**: The primary client class for interacting with the Adobe Sign REST API. Coordinates authentication, agreement operations, and token management.\n- **AdobeSignAgreements**: Manages the creation and tracking of Adobe Sign agreements (documents sent for signature).\n- **AdobeOAuthHelper** (static): Handles OAuth 2.0 authentication flows with the Adobe Sign API, including token exchange. Works with AdobeTokenResponse for parsing token responses.\n- **AdobeJwtHelper**: Manages JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication as an alternative to OAuth, supporting service-to-service API access.\n- **AdobeTokenManager** (static): Centralized token lifecycle management, handling token acquisition, refresh, and caching. Identified as a manager class though it does not extend the base Manager class.\n- **AdobeSignTokenStore** (static): In-memory or persistent storage for Adobe Sign access tokens, enabling token reuse across requests.\n- **AdobeTokenResponse**: Data transfer object for deserializing OAuth token responses from the Adobe Sign API.\n- **AdobeTemplateLogger** (static): Logging utility for tracking Adobe Sign template operations, useful for debugging and audit trails.\n\n## Patterns\n\n- **No Manager pattern**: While AdobeTokenManager contains \"Manager\" in its name, it does not extend the base Manager class and does not follow the traditional Manager/Info pattern. It is a static utility class focused on token lifecycle management.\n- **Authentication strategy pattern**: Two authentication mechanisms (OAuth via AdobeOAuthHelper, JWT via AdobeJwtHelper) provide flexibility for different deployment scenarios -- OAuth for user-delegated access and JWT for server-to-server integration.\n- **Static utility classes**: AdobeOAuthHelper, AdobeSignTokenStore, AdobeTemplateLogger, and AdobeTokenManager are all static, indicating stateless helper utilities designed for shared access across the application.\n- **Token management pattern**: A dedicated token store (AdobeSignTokenStore) and token manager (AdobeTokenManager) separate token persistence from token lifecycle logic.\n\n## Notes\n\n- No stored procedures are detected -- this module operates entirely through the Adobe Sign REST API with no direct database interaction.\n- The module provides two authentication paths (OAuth and JWT), which is important for supporting both interactive user workflows and automated background processes (e.g., Windows Services sending documents for signature).\n- This module works alongside the HelloSign module, suggesting MyEvaluations supports multiple e-signature providers to accommodate different institutional preferences.\n- During NestJS migration, this could be replaced with the Adobe Sign Node.js SDK or a direct REST client. The dual-auth pattern should be preserved.\n- The AdobeTemplateLogger class indicates template-level auditing, important for compliance in healthcare education document management.\n- The AdobeSignClient has an empty namespace in the metadata, suggesting it may be in a global or root namespace.\n\n---\n*This documentation was auto-generated from source code analysis.
