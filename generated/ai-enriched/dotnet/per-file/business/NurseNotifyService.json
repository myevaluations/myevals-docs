The Nursys eNotify service uses SOAP/WCF; the Node.js migration would require a SOAP client (e.g., node-soap) or a direct REST API equivalent if Nursys provides one. Console.WriteLine-based response handling indicates this is early-stage integration code that needs proper error handling in migration.",
