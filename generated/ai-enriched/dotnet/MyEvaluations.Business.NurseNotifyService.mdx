## Overview

The NurseNotifyService module handles notification delivery for nursing program participants within the MyEvaluations platform. It provides a dedicated service for sending notifications (email, in-app, or other channels) specific to nursing education workflows -- such as evaluation reminders, competency assessment alerts, clinical rotation updates, and compliance deadline notifications. The module contains a single class focused on nursing-specific notification actions.

## Key Classes

- **NurseActions**: The sole class in this module, responsible for executing nursing-specific notification actions. Likely orchestrates notification delivery for nursing program events, evaluation completions, and administrative alerts targeted at nursing faculty, students, and program coordinators.

## Patterns

- **Single-responsibility service**: The module contains exactly one class (`NurseActions`), following a focused service pattern dedicated to nursing notifications.
- **No Manager/Info pattern**: Does not use the standard Manager/Info data access pattern. This is a service-oriented module rather than a data access module.
- **Domain-specific notification service**: Separated from the general Mail and MailGunService modules, indicating nursing programs have specialized notification requirements distinct from GME/CME programs.
- **No stored procedure calls**: The class has no detected stored procedure calls, suggesting it delegates data access to other modules or uses a different data access mechanism.

## Notes

- This module has **no stored procedure calls**, suggesting `NurseActions` either delegates database operations to other business layer modules or consumes data passed to it from calling code.
- The existence of a dedicated nursing notification service reflects MyEvaluations' multi-program architecture (GME, CME, Nursing, PA) where each program type may have distinct notification workflows and compliance requirements.
- During NestJS migration, nursing notifications could be implemented as a specialized notification strategy within a unified notification service, using BullMQ for async delivery.
- The single-class architecture makes this one of the simplest modules to migrate -- the key challenge will be understanding the notification triggers and templates.
- Nursing program notifications may have regulatory requirements (state board compliance, clinical hour tracking) that should be preserved during migration.
