## Overview

The MailGunService module provides integration with the Mailgun transactional email delivery service. This project exists as a dedicated assembly for Mailgun API communication but currently contains **no parsed classes** (0 classes detected). This may indicate that the implementation relies entirely on configuration files, embedded resources, or that the tree-sitter parser could not extract class definitions from the source files (possibly due to unconventional code structure, partial classes, or compilation-conditional code).

## Key Classes

- No classes were detected by the source code parser. The module may contain:
  - Mailgun REST API client code
  - Email sending service implementations
  - Webhook handlers for delivery tracking
  - Configuration or reference assemblies

## Patterns

- **External service integration**: The module name indicates it wraps the Mailgun API for transactional email delivery.
- **No Manager/Info pattern**: No Manager or Info classes detected.
- **Zero parsed classes**: This could indicate the module is a thin wrapper using only external package references, or that the source files use patterns not captured by the parser.

## Notes

- The **0 class count** is notable -- the module exists as a project but no classes were extracted. This warrants manual inspection of the source files to determine actual contents.
- Mailgun is likely the platform's primary transactional email provider, handling evaluation notifications, password resets, and administrative communications.
- This module works in conjunction with `MyEvaluations.Business.Mail` (data models) and `MyEvaluations.Business.Utilities` (email scheduling) to form the complete email infrastructure.
- During NestJS migration, Mailgun integration is likely already handled by the Node.js backend (via `@mailgun/mailgun.js` or similar package), making this a natural migration candidate.
- The empty parse result should be investigated -- the actual source files may contain important integration logic that needs to be documented manually.
