## Overview

The MyHelp module implements the platform's built-in help and documentation system. It provides a hierarchical content management structure with sections, chapters, and pages -- allowing administrators to create, organize, and manage contextual help content that users can browse, search, and index. The module contains 3 classes with 2 Manager classes that together call 26 stored procedures for comprehensive help content CRUD operations.

## Key Classes

- **HelpGroupManager** (extends `Manager`): The primary manager for help content operations. Handles help sections, chapters, pages, search, indexing, and key-based content retrieval. Calls 19 stored procedures covering the full lifecycle of help content management.
- **SectionsGroupManager** (extends `Manager`): Manages the top-level section hierarchy including section CRUD operations and chapter tree view retrieval. Calls 7 stored procedures for section and tree structure management.
- **SectionInfo**: Data transfer object (Info class) representing a help section's properties, used as the return type from Manager operations.

## Patterns

- **Manager/Info pattern**: This module is a textbook example of the MyEvaluations Manager/Info pattern. `HelpGroupManager` and `SectionsGroupManager` both extend the `Manager` base class for data access, while `SectionInfo` serves as the corresponding data transfer object.
- **Hierarchical content model**: The stored procedure names reveal a three-level content hierarchy: Sections > Chapters > Pages, with tree view support.
- **Search and indexing**: Dedicated stored procedures (`GetHelpSearchResult`, `GetHelpIndexResult`) provide full-text search and alphabetical index browsing.
- **Key-based content retrieval**: Help content can be retrieved by key (`GetHelpInfoByKey`, `GetHelpInfoByKeyID`), suggesting context-sensitive help linking from UI pages.

## Notes

- This module is heavily stored-procedure-driven with **26 total stored procedures** across 2 managers, making it a significant migration effort relative to its class count.
- The hierarchical Sections/Chapters/Pages model could map to a modern CMS or knowledge base system during NestJS migration.
- `SectionInfo` is listed without a counterpart Manager in `infoCounterparts`, but contextually pairs with `SectionsGroupManager`.
- The `MovingPagesOrChapters` stored procedure suggests drag-and-drop reordering of help content is supported.
- Key-based help lookup (`GetHelpInfoByKey`) suggests deep integration with UI pages -- each page likely references a help key for contextual assistance.
- Migration priority is low since help content is administrative rather than core evaluation workflow.
