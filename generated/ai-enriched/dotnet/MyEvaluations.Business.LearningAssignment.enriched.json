With 12 classes organized around three Manager classes, it provides functionality for administering learning assignment access by department, managing a literature/learning module library (including video content), generating ledger and detailed reports, and handling assignment comments and search criteria. This module supports both voluntary and non-voluntary learning modules for healthcare education programs.\n\n## Key Classes\n\n- **LearningAssignmentAdminManager** (extends Manager): Manages learning assignment administrator access control. Paired with LearningAssignmentAdminInfo. Calls stored procedures: `GetLAAdmins`, `GetLAAdminByDepartment`, `AddLAAdmin`, `DeleteLAAdmin`.\n- **LearningAssignmentAdminInfo**: Data transfer object for learning assignment admin records, serving as the Info counterpart to LearningAssignmentAdminManager.\n- **LearningAssignmentReportManager** (extends Manager): Generates learning assignment reports using stored procedures: `GetLearningAssignmentLedgerReport`, `GetDetailedLearningAssignmentReport`.\n- **LiteratureManager** (extends Manager): The most feature-rich manager in the module, handling CRUD operations for literature and learning modules. Paired with LiteratureInfo. Calls 12 stored procedures: `GetLiteratureInfo`, `GetLiteratureInfoByIDs`, `GetLearningAssignmentLiteratureList`, `DoesLiteratureExits`, `AddLiterature`, `UpdateLiterature`, `DeleteLiterature`, `UpdateNonVoluntaryLearningModule`, `DeleteLearningModuleDocument`, `GetVideoTitle`, `GetLearningModules`, `GetLearningAssignmentLiteratureList_Voluntary`.\n- **LearningAssignmentInfo / UserLearningAssignmentInfo**: Data transfer objects for learning assignment records and user-specific assignment data.\n- **LiteratureInfo**: Info class for literature/learning module records, paired with LiteratureManager.\n- **AssignmentCommentInfo**: Stores comments associated with learning assignments.\n- **LearningAssignmentReportFilter**: Filter criteria for learning assignment report generation.\n- **LearningAssignmentSearchCriteria / LiteratureSearchCriteria**: Search parameter classes for querying assignments and literature respectively.\n\n## Patterns\n\n- **Manager/Info pattern detected**: Three Manager classes extend the base Manager class, with explicit Info counterparts: LearningAssignmentAdminManager/LearningAssignmentAdminInfo and LiteratureManager/LiteratureInfo. LearningAssignmentReportManager handles reporting without a direct Info pairing.\n- **Stored procedure-driven data access**: All database operations are performed through 18 total stored procedures across the three managers, following the legacy .NET pattern of SQL Server stored procedure calls.\n- **Search criteria pattern**: Dedicated search criteria classes (LearningAssignmentSearchCriteria, LiteratureSearchCriteria) encapsulate query parameters.\n- **Report filter pattern**: LearningAssignmentReportFilter provides a structured way to parameterize report generation.\n\n## Notes\n\n- The `DoesLiteratureExits` stored procedure name contains a typo (\"Exits\" instead of \"Exists\"), which is a legacy artifact that must be preserved for backward compatibility.\n- The distinction between voluntary and non-voluntary learning modules (`GetLearningAssignmentLiteratureList_Voluntary`, `UpdateNonVoluntaryLearningModule`) suggests compliance-driven mandatory learning requirements common in GME programs.\n- With 18 stored procedures, this module has significant database coupling that will require careful mapping during NestJS migration.\n- The LiteratureManager handles video content (`GetVideoTitle`), indicating multimedia learning support.\n- Report generation (ledger and detailed reports) is a key feature for program administrators and would need to be replicated in the Node.js backend.\n\n---\n*This documentation was auto-generated from source code analysis.
