It contains 3 classes including a dedicated ERASManager with 5 stored procedures and an XML-to-CSV converter for data transformation.\n\n## Key Classes\n\n- **ERASManager**: Core manager class for ERAS integration operations. Handles data import (`AddERASData`), field mapping (`GetERASFields`), connection status management (`UpdateERASConnectionStatus`), error code retrieval (`GetERASErrorCodes`), and dual-accreditation configuration (`UpdateERASDualAccreditation`).\n- **XMLToCSV**: Utility class for converting ERAS XML data feeds into CSV format, likely used for data import processing or reporting.\n- **Settings**: Auto-generated application settings class storing ERAS-specific configuration (API endpoints, credentials, connection parameters).\n\n## Patterns\n\n- **Manager pattern (partial)**: `ERASManager` follows the Manager naming convention and uses stored procedures for data access, but does not extend a `Manager` base class. This suggests it may predate the formalized Manager/Info pattern or was built independently.\n- **External data integration**: The module follows an import-oriented pattern -- pulling data from ERAS and persisting it locally via stored procedures.\n- **XML data processing**: `XMLToCSV` indicates ERAS data arrives in XML format, requiring transformation before consumption.\n- **Configuration-driven**: The `Settings` class suggests environment-specific ERAS configuration (likely different credentials per institution or environment).\n\n## Notes\n\n- ERAS integration is critical for GME (Graduate Medical Education) programs -- it is the primary channel through which residency applicants enter the system.\n- The `UpdateERASDualAccreditation` procedure handles programs with dual accreditation (e.g., programs accredited by both ACGME and AOA), a common scenario in medical education.\n- The **5 stored procedures** represent a focused, well-scoped integration point that should be straightforward to migrate to a NestJS service.\n- `ERASManager` does not extend the `Manager` base class, which may mean it handles its own database connections differently from other managers.\n- XML-to-CSV conversion suggests batch processing workflows; migration should consider whether real-time API integration is now available from ERAS.\n- ERAS data handling likely involves PII (applicant names, AAMC IDs) and should maintain strict data protection controls during migration.\n\n---\n*This documentation was auto-generated from source code analysis.
