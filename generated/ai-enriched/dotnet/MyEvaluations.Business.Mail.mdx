## Overview

The Mail module provides data models for training event and seminar email notifications within the MyEvaluations platform. It defines the information structures used when sending email communications about training events and seminars to program participants. This is a lightweight module with 3 classes focused on data representation rather than email sending logic (which resides in companion modules like MailGunService and the Utilities email infrastructure).

## Key Classes

- **TrainingEventsInfo**: Data transfer object representing training event details used in email notifications -- likely includes event name, date, location, participants, and notification metadata.
- **TrainingSeminarInfo**: Data transfer object representing training seminar details for email communications -- similar to TrainingEventsInfo but specific to seminar-type training activities.
- **Settings**: Auto-generated application settings class from Visual Studio designer, storing mail-related configuration (SMTP settings, sender addresses, template paths).

## Patterns

- **Info/DTO pattern**: Both `TrainingEventsInfo` and `TrainingSeminarInfo` follow the Info naming convention as pure data transfer objects, carrying training event data between the business layer and the email sending infrastructure.
- **No Manager/Info pattern**: Despite having Info classes, there are no corresponding Manager classes in this module. The Info classes here serve as email DTOs rather than database-mapped entities.
- **Separation of concerns**: Email data models are isolated from email sending logic, which lives in separate modules (MailGunService, Utilities).
- **Configuration-driven**: The `Settings` class suggests configurable mail parameters per deployment environment.

## Notes

- This module has **no stored procedure calls** -- it is purely a data model library for email-related information.
- The `TrainingEventsInfo` and `TrainingSeminarInfo` classes are likely consumed by email template rendering and notification dispatching services in other modules.
- During NestJS migration, these DTOs could become TypeScript interfaces or class-validator decorated DTOs in a shared notifications module.
- The separation between Mail (data models), MailGunService (sending), and Utilities (email scheduling) suggests the email infrastructure evolved organically and could be consolidated during migration.
- Training events and seminars are key components of CME (Continuing Medical Education) and GME program compliance tracking.
