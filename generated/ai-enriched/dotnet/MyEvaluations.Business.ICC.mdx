## Overview

The ICC (Institutional Clinical Competency) module integrates with the NAG (Numerical Analysis Group) ICC library for statistical computations used in clinical competency assessments. It provides a wrapper around numerical analysis routines, likely used for psychometric calculations, statistical scoring, or competency benchmarking within evaluation workflows. The module contains 4 classes including custom exception types for error handling during numerical computations.

## Key Classes

- **Nag_ICC** (static): The primary static class providing ICC-related numerical analysis computations. Serves as the entry point for statistical calculations.
- **NAGProgram**: Represents a NAG program configuration or execution context for running specific numerical analysis routines.
- **NagICCWarning** (extends `Exception`): Custom exception for non-fatal warnings during ICC computations (e.g., convergence warnings, boundary conditions).
- **NagICCError** (extends `Exception`): Custom exception for fatal errors during ICC computations (e.g., invalid input, computation failures).

## Patterns

- **Static utility pattern**: `Nag_ICC` is a static class, providing stateless numerical computation methods. This is typical for mathematical/statistical library wrappers.
- **Custom exception hierarchy**: Two exception classes (`NagICCWarning` and `NagICCError`) provide graduated error severity -- warnings for recoverable issues and errors for fatal computation failures.
- **No Manager/Info pattern**: This module does not use the Manager/Info data access pattern. It is a pure computation library with no stored procedure calls.
- **External library wrapper**: The module wraps the NAG numerical analysis library, isolating the third-party dependency from the rest of the codebase.

## Notes

- This module has **no stored procedure calls** and **no database interaction** -- it is a pure computation library.
- The NAG library is a commercial numerical analysis package. Migration to NestJS would need an equivalent statistical library (e.g., `simple-statistics`, `jstat`, or a Python microservice using `scipy`).
- ICC (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient) is a standard psychometric measure used in healthcare education to assess inter-rater reliability of evaluations.
- The warning/error exception separation suggests computations can partially succeed with degraded results, which should be preserved in any migration.
- As a stateless computation module, this is relatively easy to migrate or replace -- no database state or session management is involved.
- Consider whether ICC computations could be moved to the Node.js backend or delegated to a specialized analytics service.
