This is one of the foundational support modules that many other business layer assemblies depend on.\n\n## Key Classes\n\n- **ApplicationEmailSchedule**: Manages scheduled email delivery with database-backed scheduling via stored procedures (`InsertApplicationEmailSchedules`, `GetApplicationEmailSend`, `UpdateApplicationEmailSend`).\n- **FileManager** (static): Provides static file system operations (read, write, delete, path management) used across the platform.\n- **CSVExporter**: Handles data export to CSV format for reporting and data extraction needs.\n- **CommonFunctions**: General-purpose utility methods shared across the platform (likely string manipulation, date formatting, validation helpers).\n- **EmailClientSettings / EmailSendEntities / EmailModel**: Email infrastructure types defining SMTP configuration, send parameters, and email message models.\n- **EncryptKeyGen**: Encryption key generation utility for securing sensitive data (likely used for token generation or data encryption at rest).\n- **RequestRateLimiter / RequestRateLimitExceededException**: Implements request throttling with a custom exception type, protecting APIs and external service calls from abuse.\n- **TelnyxSmsService**: SMS messaging integration via the Telnyx provider, enabling text notifications to users (appointment reminders, evaluation alerts).\n- **Factory**: Implements the Factory design pattern for object creation, likely providing dependency resolution for business layer components.\n- **PersistComponent** (extends `System.Web.UI.Page`): WebForms page base class for managing component state persistence across postbacks.\n- **SearchCriteria**: Encapsulates search/filter parameters for building dynamic database queries.\n- **ZipUtil**: ZIP file compression/decompression utility for handling file archives.\n- **Settings**: Auto-generated application settings class from Visual Studio designer.\n\n## Patterns\n\n- **Manager pattern (partial)**: `FileManager` follows the Manager naming convention but as a static utility class rather than the full Manager/Info data access pattern.\n- **Factory pattern**: The `Factory` class provides centralized object creation.\n- **Custom exception pattern**: `RequestRateLimitExceededException` extends `Exception` for domain-specific error handling in rate limiting scenarios.\n- **WebForms integration**: `PersistComponent` extends `System.Web.UI.Page`, tying this module to the legacy ASP.NET WebForms infrastructure.\n- **External service integration**: `TelnyxSmsService` wraps the Telnyx SMS API for notification delivery.\n\n## Notes\n\n- This module has **3 stored procedures** related to email scheduling (`InsertApplicationEmailSchedules`, `GetApplicationEmailSend`, `UpdateApplicationEmailSend`).
