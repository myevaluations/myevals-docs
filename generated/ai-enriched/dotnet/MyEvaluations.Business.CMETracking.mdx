## Overview

The **MyEvaluations.Business.CMETracking** module manages Continuing Medical Education (CME) credit tracking across the MyEvaluations platform. It contains **44 classes** covering CME event management, credit types, certificates, evaluations, financial reporting, connectivity/integration configuration, email database management, course materials, guest presenters, learning objectives, and question management.

CME tracking is a critical compliance feature that enables medical institutions to plan, deliver, and document continuing education activities, track credit hours, manage attendee evaluations, and produce financial and accreditation reports. This module supports the ACCME (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education) requirements that institutions must meet.

## Key Classes

### Core Business Managers
- **`CMEBusinessClass`** (extends `Manager`) -- Primary business logic class for CME operations. Located in `CMEBusinessClass.cs`.
- **`CmeEventManager`** (extends `Manager`) -- Manages CME event lifecycle (creation, scheduling, registration). Located in `CmeEventManager.cs`.
- **`CerificateManager`** (extends `Manager`) -- CRUD operations for CME certificates via 8 stored procedures including `GetCMECertificateList`, `AddCertificate`, `UpdateCertificate`, `DeleteCertificate`. Located in `CertificateManager.cs`.
- **`CreditTypeManager`** (extends `Manager`) -- Manages credit types (AMA PRA Category 1, MOC, etc.) via 7 stored procedures. Located in `CreditTypeManager.cs`.

### Financial & Credentialing
- **`CMEFinancialManager`** (extends `Manager`) -- CME financial reporting via `GetCMEFinancialReport` and `GetCMEFinancialResultsReport`. Located in `CMEFinancialManager.cs`.
- **`CMEFinancialBussiness`** (extends `Manager`) -- Additional financial business logic. Located in `CMEFinancialBussiness.cs`.
- **`CMECredentialManager`** (extends `Manager`) -- Manages credentialing information and max event credits via 3 stored procedures. Located in `CMECredentialManager.cs`.

### Connectivity & Integration
- **`CMEConnectivityManager`** (extends `Manager`) -- Manages third-party integrations (satellite programs, merchant services) via 9 stored procedures including `GetConnectivityNames`, `SaveDepartmentConnectivityInfo`, `GetCMESatelliteProgramsDepartments`. Located in `CMEConnectivityManager.cs`.

### Evaluation System
- **`EvaluationInfo`** -- Primary evaluation DTO containing evaluation responses, barrier answers, learning objectives, and topic credits. Located in `EvaluationInfo.cs`.
- **`CMEQuizInfo`** -- Quiz data for CME knowledge assessments.
- **`EvaluationCommentsInfo`**, **`EvaluationAnswerInfo`**, **`EvaluationBarrierAnswerInfo`** -- Granular evaluation response DTOs.
- **`EvaluationLearningObjectiveInfo`**, **`EvaluationTopicCredits`** -- Learning outcome and credit allocation DTOs.
- **`EvaluationSearchCriteria`** -- Search/filter parameters for evaluation queries.
- **`QuestionManager`** (extends `Manager`) -- Manages CME evaluation questions and audience lists via `GetCMEAudienceList` and `GetCMEQuestionCategories`.

### Email & Communication
- **`EmailDatabaseManager`** (extends `Manager`) -- Manages CME email distribution lists via 4 stored procedures including `GetEmailDBListByCriteria` and `SaveScheduleList`. Located in `EmailDatabaseManager.cs`.
- **`UploadNameOfList`** -- Bulk email list import/management with 9 stored procedures for upload, delete, restore, and user management.

### Guest & Lecturer Management
- **`GuestManager`** -- Manages guest/external presenters for CME events via `AddCMEGuestPresenters`, `UpdateCMEGuestPresenters`, `GetCMEGuestInfoByID`.
- **`LearningObjectiveManager`** -- Manages learning objectives for CME activities.

### Course & Content
- **`CourseInfo`**, **`CourseHandOutInfo`**, **`CourseVideoInfo`** -- Course content DTOs for materials, handouts, and video resources.
- **`FileInfo`** -- File attachment metadata for course materials.

### Supporting DTOs
- **`AssignmentInfo`** / **`AssignmentManager`** -- CME assignment tracking.
- **`EventInfo`** / **`EventSearchCriteria`** -- CME event data and search parameters.
- **`CmeEventInfo`** -- Detailed CME event information DTO.
- **`LecturerInfo`** -- Lecturer/speaker profile data.
- **`SupportSourceInfo`** -- Financial/commercial support source tracking (ACCME disclosure requirement).
- **`ScheduleTemplateInfo`**, **`TemplateInfo`** -- Event scheduling templates.
- **`RegisterCMEEvent`** -- Event registration data model.

## Patterns

1. **Manager/Info Pattern** -- 8 Manager-Info counterpart pairs (e.g., `CmeEventManager`/`CmeEventInfo`, `CreditTypeManager`/`CreditTypeInfo`, `GuestManager`/`GuestInfo`).
2. **Stored Procedure Delegation** -- 11 manager classes collectively invoke ~40 stored procedures for all data access.
3. **Search Criteria Pattern** -- Dedicated `*SearchCriteria` classes encapsulate filter parameters for list queries (`EvaluationSearchCriteria`, `EventSearchCriteria`).
4. **Bulk Import Pattern** -- `UploadNameOfList` class handles bulk CSV/Excel import of email contacts with stored procedures for validation, import, delete, and restore operations.
5. **Multi-File DTO Groups** -- Evaluation-related DTOs are grouped in `EvaluationInfo.cs` (7 classes), demonstrating the legacy pattern of co-locating related types.

## Notes

- This module has **11 manager classes** and **~40 stored procedure calls**, making it one of the more complex modules.
- The `CerificateManager` class name contains a typo ("Cerificate" instead of "Certificate") -- this should be corrected during migration.
- `CMEFinancialBussiness` also contains a typo ("Bussiness" instead of "Business").
- The `CMEConnectivityManager` handles satellite program and merchant service integrations, which may involve external API calls that need special attention during migration.
- ACCME compliance features (support source disclosure, credit type management, certificate generation) are regulatory requirements that must be faithfully replicated in any migration.
- The `Settings` class in `Properties/Settings.Designer.cs` is auto-generated .NET configuration -- this maps to NestJS `ConfigService` or environment variables.
