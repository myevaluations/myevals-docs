## Overview

The Utilities module is a shared library providing cross-cutting concerns and common functionality used throughout the MyEvaluations platform. With 16 classes, it covers email scheduling and configuration, file management, CSV export, encryption key generation, rate limiting, SMS services, search criteria building, ZIP file handling, and a factory pattern implementation. This is one of the foundational support modules that many other business layer assemblies depend on.

## Key Classes

- **ApplicationEmailSchedule**: Manages scheduled email delivery with database-backed scheduling via stored procedures (`InsertApplicationEmailSchedules`, `GetApplicationEmailSend`, `UpdateApplicationEmailSend`).
- **FileManager** (static): Provides static file system operations (read, write, delete, path management) used across the platform.
- **CSVExporter**: Handles data export to CSV format for reporting and data extraction needs.
- **CommonFunctions**: General-purpose utility methods shared across the platform (likely string manipulation, date formatting, validation helpers).
- **EmailClientSettings / EmailSendEntities / EmailModel**: Email infrastructure types defining SMTP configuration, send parameters, and email message models.
- **EncryptKeyGen**: Encryption key generation utility for securing sensitive data (likely used for token generation or data encryption at rest).
- **RequestRateLimiter / RequestRateLimitExceededException**: Implements request throttling with a custom exception type, protecting APIs and external service calls from abuse.
- **TelnyxSmsService**: SMS messaging integration via the Telnyx provider, enabling text notifications to users (appointment reminders, evaluation alerts).
- **Factory**: Implements the Factory design pattern for object creation, likely providing dependency resolution for business layer components.
- **PersistComponent** (extends `System.Web.UI.Page`): WebForms page base class for managing component state persistence across postbacks.
- **SearchCriteria**: Encapsulates search/filter parameters for building dynamic database queries.
- **ZipUtil**: ZIP file compression/decompression utility for handling file archives.
- **Settings**: Auto-generated application settings class from Visual Studio designer.

## Patterns

- **Manager pattern (partial)**: `FileManager` follows the Manager naming convention but as a static utility class rather than the full Manager/Info data access pattern.
- **Factory pattern**: The `Factory` class provides centralized object creation.
- **Custom exception pattern**: `RequestRateLimitExceededException` extends `Exception` for domain-specific error handling in rate limiting scenarios.
- **WebForms integration**: `PersistComponent` extends `System.Web.UI.Page`, tying this module to the legacy ASP.NET WebForms infrastructure.
- **External service integration**: `TelnyxSmsService` wraps the Telnyx SMS API for notification delivery.

## Notes

- This module has **3 stored procedures** related to email scheduling (`InsertApplicationEmailSchedules`, `GetApplicationEmailSend`, `UpdateApplicationEmailSend`). These would need equivalent NestJS service methods during migration.
- The `PersistComponent` class directly extends `System.Web.UI.Page`, making it tightly coupled to WebForms. This class will become obsolete during the React/Next.js frontend migration.
- `TelnyxSmsService` should be migrated as a standalone NestJS service module with proper configuration management.
- The `RequestRateLimiter` functionality maps well to NestJS built-in throttling (`@nestjs/throttler`).
- `FileManager` being static makes it difficult to test; migration should use injectable services.
- The `ZipUtil` class has an empty namespace, suggesting it may predate the namespace conventions of the rest of the codebase.
