## Overview

The EssentialActivities module manages clinical essential activities tracking for nursing education programs within MyEvaluations, with a particular focus on DNP (Doctor of Nursing Practice) and FNP (Family Nurse Practitioner) programs. With 9 classes, the module handles DNP essential data entry and course management, FNP clinical log tracking and review, automated evaluation assignments based on FNP schedules, and development/reporting utilities. It also supports linking BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing) and general evaluations to courses.

## Key Classes

- **AddDNPManager**: Manager class for DNP essential activities data operations. Calls stored procedures: `GetCourseDetails`, `SaveDNPInfo`. Note: does not extend the base Manager class in the parsed metadata.
- **DevManager**: Development and reporting manager for FNP program data. Calls 5 stored procedures: `DEV_GetFNPUsersBySessionsAndCourses`, `DEV_GetFNPStudentDetailsLogs`, `DEV_GetSessionsForReport`, `DEV_GetFNPClinicalLogReview`, `DEV_GetFNPCourseInfo`. The `DEV_` prefix suggests these may be development/diagnostic utilities or were initially created for development purposes.
- **FNPAutomaticEvaluationAssignments**: Handles automated evaluation assignment generation for FNP programs based on schedule data. Calls stored procedures: `AutomaticFNPEvaluationAssignments`, `GetLastUpdatedDatesForFNPSchedules`.
- **AddDNPEssentials**: Data entity for DNP essential activities input.
- **AddDNPData**: Data transfer object for DNP data submission payloads.
- **DNPLog**: Logging/audit entity for DNP essential activity operations.
- **FNPLogData**: Clinical log data entity for FNP student activity tracking.
- **LinkBSNEvaluationtoCoursesEntity**: Entity for linking BSN program evaluations to specific courses.
- **LinkEvaluationtoCoursesEntity**: Entity for linking general evaluations to courses.

## Patterns

- **Manager/Info pattern detected**: AddDNPManager and DevManager serve as manager classes, though neither extends the base Manager class in the parsed output. This may indicate a variant pattern or a parsing limitation. FNPAutomaticEvaluationAssignments also contains business logic with stored procedure calls but follows a task-oriented naming pattern rather than the Manager convention.
- **Stored procedure-driven data access**: 9 total stored procedures across three classes handle all database operations.
- **Program-specific specialization**: Classes are organized by nursing program type (DNP, FNP, BSN) rather than by functional domain, reflecting the specialized requirements of each program track.
- **Automated assignment pattern**: FNPAutomaticEvaluationAssignments implements a schedule-driven automatic evaluation assignment workflow, likely triggered by a Windows Service or scheduled task.
- **Evaluation-course linking**: LinkBSNEvaluationtoCoursesEntity and LinkEvaluationtoCoursesEntity represent many-to-many relationships between evaluations and courses.

## Notes

- The `DEV_` prefix on DevManager stored procedures is unusual and may indicate development-only or diagnostic functionality that should be reviewed before migration.
- This module is nursing-education specific (DNP, FNP, BSN), making it a specialized vertical within the broader MyEvaluations platform that primarily serves GME/residency programs.
- The automatic FNP evaluation assignment feature (`FNPAutomaticEvaluationAssignments`) depends on schedule synchronization timestamps, suggesting it runs as a periodic background job.
- The module's manager classes do not appear to extend the base Manager class (per parsed metadata), which may indicate a newer or alternative implementation pattern, or a tree-sitter parsing limitation with the inheritance chain.
- During NestJS migration, the program-specific logic (DNP, FNP, BSN) should be organized as sub-modules within an EssentialActivities domain module.
- Clinical log tracking (FNPLogData, DNPLog) serves accreditation and compliance requirements for nursing programs.
