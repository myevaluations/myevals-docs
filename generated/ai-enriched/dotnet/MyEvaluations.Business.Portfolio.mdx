## Overview

The Portfolio module manages trainee and resident personal portfolio data within MyEvaluations. With 9 classes, it provides a comprehensive personal information management system covering demographics, academic credentials (degrees, post-graduation), professional licenses, military service records, tax information, and employment contracts. The module centers on a LookUpTables manager that serves as the primary data access layer, retrieving reference data from 24 stored procedures spanning departments, users, specialties, programs, certificates, competencies, and document access levels.

## Key Classes

- **LookUpTables** (extends Manager): The central data access manager for portfolio-related reference data. Despite its name, it functions as the primary Portfolio manager, calling 24 stored procedures: `GetListOfDepartments`, `GetUserInfoByDepartmentID`, `GetImageInfoByUserID`, `GetSpecialtyNameBySpecialtyCode`, `GetUserTitleByUserID`, `GetRolePreceptorIDs`, `GetPFDocumentAccessLevel`, `GetCompetency`, `GetRoleIDByUserID`, `GetSpecialtyList`, `GetProgramList`, `GetDepartmentIDByProgramID`, `GetProgramDepartments`, `GetMaxPGYByUserIDOrDepartmentID`, `GetCertificateList`, `GetUserTypeByID`, `GetDependentType`, `GetUniformType`, `GetLevelList`, `GetInstitutionName`, `GetTrainingGapType`, `GetUserProgramList`, `GetInstitutionEmployerNames`, `GetDepartmentInfo`, `GetPFDocumentSettMaxPgyByID`, `GetUserImageFileName`.
- **ContractsEntity**: Entity class for trainee employment/training contracts.
- **MyPortfolioGeneralDemogrpahicsEntity**: General demographic information entity (note: legacy typo "Demogrpahics").
- **MyPortfolioDegreeEntity**: Academic degree records for portfolio holders.
- **MyPortfolioPostGraduationEntity**: Post-graduation training and education records.
- **MyPortfolioLicencesEntity**: Professional license and certification records.
- **MyPortfolioUserMilitaryEntity**: Military service history records.
- **MyPortfolioTaxEntity**: Tax-related information for trainees.

## Patterns

- **Manager/Info pattern detected**: LookUpTables extends the base Manager class, though it deviates from naming conventions by being named as a lookup utility rather than following the typical "[Domain]Manager" pattern. The entity classes use an "Entity" suffix rather than the typical "Info" suffix.
- **Entity-based data model**: Uses "Entity" suffix classes (ContractsEntity, MyPortfolioDegreeEntity, etc.) rather than the more common "Info" suffix found in other modules, suggesting this module may have been developed at a different time or by a different team.
- **Reference data hub**: LookUpTables serves as a centralized reference data provider with 24 stored procedures covering organizational hierarchy (departments, programs, specialties), user roles, competencies, and document access.
- **Document access control**: `GetPFDocumentAccessLevel` and `GetPFDocumentSettMaxPgyByID` indicate role-based document visibility tied to PGY levels.

## Notes

- The LookUpTables class has 24 stored procedures, making it one of the most database-coupled classes in the system. During migration, these should be split into focused NestJS service methods.
- The "Demogrpahics" typo in MyPortfolioGeneralDemogrpahicsEntity is a legacy artifact preserved for backward compatibility.
- No explicit portfolio CRUD manager was detected -- the LookUpTables class handles reads while create/update/delete operations may reside in another module or use a different pattern.
- The portfolio data model covers sensitive personal information (military records, tax data, licenses) requiring careful security considerations during migration.
- Image handling (`GetImageInfoByUserID`, `GetUserImageFileName`) suggests profile photo management is part of the portfolio feature.
- PGY-level document access (`GetPFDocumentSettMaxPgyByID`, `GetMaxPGYByUserIDOrDepartmentID`) enforces training-year-based visibility rules.
