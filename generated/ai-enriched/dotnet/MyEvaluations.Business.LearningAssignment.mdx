## Overview

The LearningAssignment module manages the creation, assignment, tracking, and reporting of learning assignments and literature resources within MyEvaluations. With 12 classes organized around three Manager classes, it provides functionality for administering learning assignment access by department, managing a literature/learning module library (including video content), generating ledger and detailed reports, and handling assignment comments and search criteria. This module supports both voluntary and non-voluntary learning modules for healthcare education programs.

## Key Classes

- **LearningAssignmentAdminManager** (extends Manager): Manages learning assignment administrator access control. Paired with LearningAssignmentAdminInfo. Calls stored procedures: `GetLAAdmins`, `GetLAAdminByDepartment`, `AddLAAdmin`, `DeleteLAAdmin`.
- **LearningAssignmentAdminInfo**: Data transfer object for learning assignment admin records, serving as the Info counterpart to LearningAssignmentAdminManager.
- **LearningAssignmentReportManager** (extends Manager): Generates learning assignment reports using stored procedures: `GetLearningAssignmentLedgerReport`, `GetDetailedLearningAssignmentReport`.
- **LiteratureManager** (extends Manager): The most feature-rich manager in the module, handling CRUD operations for literature and learning modules. Paired with LiteratureInfo. Calls 12 stored procedures: `GetLiteratureInfo`, `GetLiteratureInfoByIDs`, `GetLearningAssignmentLiteratureList`, `DoesLiteratureExits`, `AddLiterature`, `UpdateLiterature`, `DeleteLiterature`, `UpdateNonVoluntaryLearningModule`, `DeleteLearningModuleDocument`, `GetVideoTitle`, `GetLearningModules`, `GetLearningAssignmentLiteratureList_Voluntary`.
- **LearningAssignmentInfo / UserLearningAssignmentInfo**: Data transfer objects for learning assignment records and user-specific assignment data.
- **LiteratureInfo**: Info class for literature/learning module records, paired with LiteratureManager.
- **AssignmentCommentInfo**: Stores comments associated with learning assignments.
- **LearningAssignmentReportFilter**: Filter criteria for learning assignment report generation.
- **LearningAssignmentSearchCriteria / LiteratureSearchCriteria**: Search parameter classes for querying assignments and literature respectively.

## Patterns

- **Manager/Info pattern detected**: Three Manager classes extend the base Manager class, with explicit Info counterparts: LearningAssignmentAdminManager/LearningAssignmentAdminInfo and LiteratureManager/LiteratureInfo. LearningAssignmentReportManager handles reporting without a direct Info pairing.
- **Stored procedure-driven data access**: All database operations are performed through 18 total stored procedures across the three managers, following the legacy .NET pattern of SQL Server stored procedure calls.
- **Search criteria pattern**: Dedicated search criteria classes (LearningAssignmentSearchCriteria, LiteratureSearchCriteria) encapsulate query parameters.
- **Report filter pattern**: LearningAssignmentReportFilter provides a structured way to parameterize report generation.

## Notes

- The `DoesLiteratureExits` stored procedure name contains a typo ("Exits" instead of "Exists"), which is a legacy artifact that must be preserved for backward compatibility.
- The distinction between voluntary and non-voluntary learning modules (`GetLearningAssignmentLiteratureList_Voluntary`, `UpdateNonVoluntaryLearningModule`) suggests compliance-driven mandatory learning requirements common in GME programs.
- With 18 stored procedures, this module has significant database coupling that will require careful mapping during NestJS migration.
- The LiteratureManager handles video content (`GetVideoTitle`), indicating multimedia learning support.
- Report generation (ledger and detailed reports) is a key feature for program administrators and would need to be replicated in the Node.js backend.
