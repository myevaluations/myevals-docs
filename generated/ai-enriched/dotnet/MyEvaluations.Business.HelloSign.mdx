## Overview

The HelloSign module provides a .NET SDK wrapper for the HelloSign (now Dropbox Sign) e-signature platform, enabling MyEvaluations to send, track, and manage electronic signature requests for program-related documents. With 45 classes, the module implements a comprehensive client library covering accounts, signature requests (file-based and template-based), embedded signing flows, OAuth authentication, signers, templates, teams, events/webhooks, and a robust exception hierarchy for API error handling. This is a third-party integration library adapted for MyEvaluations' document signing needs in healthcare education workflows.

## Key Classes

- **SignatureRequest** (extends BaseSignatureRequest): Core class representing a signature request with file attachments. Works with FileContainer and FileSignatureRequestBuilder for constructing requests.
- **BaseSignatureRequest**: Base class for all signature request types, providing shared properties and behavior.
- **TemplateSignatureRequest** (extends BaseSignatureRequest): Signature request created from a pre-defined HelloSign template, enabling standardized document workflows.
- **EmbeddedSign** (extends Embedded): Enables embedded (in-app) signing experiences where users sign documents within the MyEvaluations UI rather than being redirected to HelloSign.
- **EmbeddedTemplate** (extends Embedded): Manages embedded template editing flows.
- **EmbeddedTemplateDraft** (extends SignatureRequest): Represents a draft embedded template with merge field support.
- **Signer** (extends SignerRole): Represents an individual signer on a signature request, with role-based assignment capabilities.
- **Account**: HelloSign account management and configuration.
- **Template**: Reusable document template definitions.
- **Event / EventMetadata / EventHashInfo**: Webhook event processing classes for handling signature status callbacks from HelloSign.
- **Oauth**: OAuth authentication flow for HelloSign API access.
- **ObjectList** (implements IEnumerable\<T\>): Generic paginated list container for API responses.
- **Program**: Entry point class in the MyEvaluations.HelloSign namespace.
- **Exception hierarchy**: ErrorException base with specialized exceptions -- BadRequestException, UnauthorizedException, PaymentRequiredException, ForbiddenException, NotFoundException, MethodNotAllowedException, ConflictException, GoneException, UnknownException, ServiceUnavailableException, ExceededRateLimitException -- mapping HTTP status codes to typed exceptions.

## Patterns

- **No Manager pattern**: This module does not follow the typical Manager/Info pattern. It is structured as a third-party SDK wrapper with domain model classes rather than MyEvaluations business managers.
- **Inheritance hierarchies**: Three distinct hierarchies -- BaseSignatureRequest for request types, Embedded for embedded flow types, and ErrorException for API error types.
- **Builder pattern**: FileSignatureRequestBuilder provides a fluent interface for constructing file-based signature requests.
- **Webhook/Event pattern**: Event, EventMetadata, and EventHashInfo classes support secure webhook processing with hash verification for signature status updates.
- **Exception mapping**: A comprehensive exception hierarchy maps HelloSign API HTTP error codes to strongly-typed .NET exceptions.

## Notes

- HelloSign has been rebranded to Dropbox Sign. This module may need updates if the API endpoints or SDK change due to the rebrand.
- No stored procedures are detected -- this module operates entirely through the HelloSign REST API with no direct database interaction.
- The module contains a `Class1.cs` placeholder file in the MyEvaluations.Business.HelloSign namespace, suggesting the module was scaffolded and may have incomplete areas.
- During NestJS migration, this integration could be replaced with the official Dropbox Sign Node.js SDK or a direct REST API client.
- The embedded signing flow (EmbeddedSign, EmbeddedTemplate) is particularly important for user experience, as it keeps signers within the MyEvaluations application.
- Event webhook handling with hash verification (EventHashInfo, EventHashException) is a security-critical component that must be preserved in any migration.
