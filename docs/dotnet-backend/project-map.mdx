## Dependency Flow

The dependency hierarchy flows from bottom (foundational) to top (consumer):

    end

    subgraph "Cross-Cutting"

        Schedulers["70+ Schedulers"]
    end

```

### Key Dependency Rules

1. **DataAccess.SQL** has no dependencies on business projects -- it is purely foundational
2. **Common** depends on DataAccess.SQL and Logging -- all business projects depend on Common
3. **Business projects** depend on Common and DataAccess.SQL; they do **not** reference each other (with rare exceptions)
4. **Web** references all business projects it needs for page rendering
5. **Schedulers** reference only the business projects they need for their specific task
6. **No circular dependencies** -- the dependency graph is a DAG (directed acyclic graph)

## Vendored Dependencies

The `Web/Reference DLL/` directory contains vendored third-party DLLs that are not available via NuGet:

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: Specific DLL names and versions will be enriched from file system analysis -->

| DLL | Purpose | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| Various FusionChart DLLs | Chart rendering | Licensed component |
| CKFinder DLLs | File management UI | Licensed component |
| Various legacy DLLs | Historical dependencies | May include older library versions |

:::note
These vendored DLLs are committed to the repository because they are not available through NuGet. This is a legacy practice; modern projects use NuGet exclusively.
