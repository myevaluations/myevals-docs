# UserControls File Reference

**142 files** · **77,838 lines** · Generated 2/21/2026

Web/UserControls contains reusable ASP.NET user controls (.ascx) shared across multiple pages - navigation menus, data grids, filter panels, date pickers, file uploaders, and modal dialogs. This second batch covers evaluation-specific controls (audience selectors, template pickers, grade selectors, report menus, user filters), navigation controls (breadcrumbs, tabs, top menu), lookup controls (generic dropdown variants), mail distribution controls, security/OBC configuration controls, session management, and common layout controls (headers, footers, sub-headers, message displays).

**Key Workflows**

- Shared UI components for page composition (headers, footers, sub-headers, breadcrumbs)
- Evaluation report filter controls (evaluation selection, rotation selection, user selection, evaluator selection)
- Report navigation menus with extensive role-based access control (ReportMenuList, ReportManagementMenuList)
- Generic lookup dropdown controls with multiple variants (state, events, events+state)
- User selection dual-listbox controls with rich filtering (PGY, groups, types, specialty, departments)
- Evaluation template configuration controls (template options, audience, grades)
- Session timeout management and modal popup controls
- Mail distribution recipient selection with template persistence
- OBC/security configuration controls for custom fields, document types, requirement groups
- Navigation and menu components (TabsMenu, TopMenu) with role-based module visibility
