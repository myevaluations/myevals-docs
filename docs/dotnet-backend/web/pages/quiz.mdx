The Quiz module provides a comprehensive assessment and testing system for medical education programs. It supports the full lifecycle of quiz management including quiz design, question bank management (organized by specialty/topic), question import, assignment creation with multi-step wizards, quiz taking with timed responses and browser logging, results review, and template sharing across departments. The module integrates with learning assignments and on-call scheduling, and includes three report types (Detailed, Ledger, Summary) plus a comprehensive analysis report with FusionCharts visualization. The architecture uses extensive business layer delegation through QuizBusiness and ManageQuizAssignmentsBusiness classes.

**Key Workflows**

- Quiz design with multi-step wizard for question creation and quiz configuration
- Quiz assignment with user/group selection, scheduling, and period configuration
- Quiz taking with timed responses, browser logging, and access audit trail
- Quiz results review with pass/fail scoring and question-level analysis
- Question bank management organized by specialty and topic hierarchy
- Quiz question import from external files
- Quiz template sharing across departments
- Voluntary quiz self-enrollment for self-directed learning
- Quiz reminder scheduling via automated endpoints
- Three report types: Detailed Assignments, Ledger, Summary Performance plus Analysis Report with charts
