Modern frontend integration layer (Web/New) serving as .NET shell pages that host React-based UI components. All pages follow the same pattern: initialize NewFrontend helper for React CDN embedding, authenticate via New_Auth, and check permissions. These represent the strangler fig migration pattern where React components progressively replace WebForms pages. Key areas migrated: program assessments, core personnel, accreditation documentation, requirement sets, and SIMPL data import.

**Key Workflows**

- Initialize React frontend within .NET WebForms shell via NewFrontend helper
- Authenticate users through New_Auth bridge between .NET sessions and React frontend
- Permission-gated access to migrated React modules (assessments, personnel, accreditation)
- Print-optimized rendering for React-based pages via PrintBasePage
