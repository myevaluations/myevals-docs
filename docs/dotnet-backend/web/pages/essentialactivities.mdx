**Key Workflows**

- Clinical log entry and faculty/admin review workflow
- Course management and student enrollment
- Evaluation assignment and tracking (FNP, DNP)
- Clinical Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) lifecycle
- Session and roster management
- Clinical data export and SalesForce integration
- Faculty and preceptor evaluation reporting
- DNP/FNP program-specific report generation
- Banner data import and student synchronization
- Course objective tracking and reporting
