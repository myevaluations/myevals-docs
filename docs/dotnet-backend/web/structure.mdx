# Web Project Structure

The `Web/` project is the ASP.NET WebForms application that serves the MyEvaluations user interface. It contains **50+ subdirectories** organized by feature area, each containing ASPX pages, code-behind files, user controls, and static assets. This is the largest project in the solution by file count.

## Key Root Files

### Global.asax

Application lifecycle events, error handling, and startup configuration:

```csharp
public class Global : HttpApplication
{
    void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Configure routing
        // Initialize caching
        // Set up error handling
    }

    void Application_Error(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Global error handler
        // Log to database
        // Redirect to error page
    }

    void Session_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Initialize user session
        // Load user preferences
    }
}
```

### web.config

Central configuration file containing:
- Connection strings
- Authentication and authorization settings
- Custom HTTP handlers and modules
- Application settings (feature flags, API keys, timeouts)
- IIS configuration (URL rewrite rules, static content settings)

### Default.aspx

The application entry point that redirects authenticated users to their role-specific dashboard.

## Master Pages

The application uses ASP.NET Master Pages for consistent layout:

| Master Page | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `Site.Master` | Main application layout (header, navigation, sidebar, footer) |
| `Admin.Master` | Administration pages layout (extended navigation) |
| `Print.Master` | Print-friendly layout (no navigation, minimal styling) |
| `Blank.Master` | Minimal layout for popups and embedded content |
| `NewFrontend.Master` | Layout for React-embedded pages |
