# Business.Common

The `Business.Common` module provides the foundational infrastructure shared across every Business layer module in the MyEvaluations .NET backend. It defines the abstract `Manager` base class that all module managers inherit from, the `CacheManager` for in-process caching, the `EventManager` for application event logging, and common types, constants, and dashboard utilities used throughout the system.

Because this module has no dependencies on other Business modules, it sits at the lowest layer of the dependency stack — every other module depends on it either directly or transitively.

## Key Classes

| Class | Lines | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `Manager` | ~80 | Abstract base class for all Business layer Manager classes. Provides shared constructor patterns, database connection initialization, and common helper methods. |
| `CacheManager` | ~120 | In-process caching for frequently accessed lookup data (roles, permissions, institution config). Wraps `System.Runtime.Caching.MemoryCache` with typed get/set/invalidate helpers. |
| `EventManager` | ~95 | Application event logging. Writes structured events (user actions, system events, errors) to the `EventLog` table for audit and debugging purposes. |
| `CommonTypes` | ~60 | Shared enum definitions, type aliases, and DTO base interfaces used across all modules. |
| `DashBoard` | ~110 | Dashboard data aggregation helper. Retrieves cross-module summary counts (pending evaluations, duty hour violations, due activities) for role-based dashboard pages. |
| `Constants` | ~40 | Application-wide string constants, configuration keys, and magic number definitions. |
