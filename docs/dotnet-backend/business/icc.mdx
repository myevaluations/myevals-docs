# ICC (In-Training / Clinical Competency Committee)

<!-- Content will be enriched by AI parsing scripts -->

## Overview

The ICC module supports Clinical Competency Committee (CCC) operations, which are required by the ACGME for all residency and fellowship programs. The CCC is responsible for reviewing trainee performance data at least semi-annually and making recommendations about trainee progression, including milestone assessments, remediation plans, and promotion or dismissal decisions.

This module aggregates data from evaluations, procedures, duty hours, and portfolios to present a comprehensive trainee profile to committee members. It manages the committee meeting workflow, milestone level assignments, and formal documentation of CCC decisions.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Committee Management**: Define CCC membership, meeting schedules, and quorum requirements
- **Data Aggregation**: Pull trainee performance data from all relevant modules for committee review
- **Milestone Assessment**: Facilitate semi-annual milestone level assignments by CCC members
- **Meeting Workflow**: Structured meeting process with resident review, discussion, and voting
- **Decision Documentation**: Record CCC recommendations (advancement, remediation, probation, dismissal)
- **ACGME Reporting**: Generate milestone data for ACGME WebADS submission
