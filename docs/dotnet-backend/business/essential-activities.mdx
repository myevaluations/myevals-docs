# Essential Activities

<!-- Content will be enriched by AI parsing scripts -->

## Overview

The Essential Activities module tracks required clinical and educational activities for nursing and physician assistant (PA) programs. Unlike the ACGME-focused procedures and milestones modules used by GME programs, essential activities are tailored to the competency frameworks and accreditation requirements of nursing (AACN/CCNE standards) and PA (ARC-PA standards) education programs.

Essential activities encompass clinical skills demonstrations, simulation lab completions, community health activities, interprofessional education experiences, and program-specific requirements that students must complete before graduation or clinical placement.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Activity Definition**: Define program-specific essential activities with competency mappings and completion criteria
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor student progress toward completing all required activities
- **Competency Mapping**: Map activities to nursing/PA competency frameworks (AACN Essentials, ARC-PA competencies)
- **Verification Workflows**: Faculty verification and sign-off on activity completion
- **Requirements Compliance**: Track completion against program graduation requirements
- **Reporting**: Program-level compliance reports and individual student progress dashboards
