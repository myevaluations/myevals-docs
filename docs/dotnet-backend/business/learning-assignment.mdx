# Learning Assignments

<!-- Content will be enriched by AI parsing scripts -->

## Overview

The Learning Assignments module manages the distribution and tracking of educational content to trainees and faculty. Programs assign learning materials -- such as articles, videos, policy documents, online modules, and quizzes -- to users with due dates and completion tracking. This module supports mandatory compliance training (e.g., HIPAA, safety), program-specific curriculum delivery, and self-directed learning.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Assignment Creation**: Create and distribute learning materials with configurable due dates, target audiences, and completion criteria
- **Completion Tracking**: Monitor assignment completion status with timestamps, attempts, and scores
- **Due Date Management**: Configurable due dates with automated reminders at multiple intervals
- **Curriculum Management**: Group assignments into curricula or learning paths for structured training
- **Quiz Integration**: Link assignments to quiz assessments for knowledge verification
- **Compliance Reporting**: Track mandatory training completion rates for compliance audits
