# Business.MyHelp

The `Business.MyHelp` module powers the **in-app help system** embedded in the MyEvaluations web application. Rather than redirecting users to an external knowledge base, MyEvaluations serves contextual help content inline via a dedicated help panel. This module manages the content hierarchy (groups → sections → articles), controls which help items are visible to which user roles, and provides the Business layer API used by the `Web/MyHelp/` pages to render help content.

Help content is managed by administrators through the web UI and stored in the database — no content is hard-coded in source files.

## Key Classes

| Class | Lines | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `HelpGroupManager` | ~95 | CRUD operations for top-level help groups (e.g., "Evaluations", "Duty Hours"). Controls group visibility by user role and institution. |
| `SectionsGroupManager` | ~110 | Manages the mapping between help sections and groups. Handles ordering, visibility rules, and section-to-page context bindings. |
| `SectionInfoBusiness` | ~130 | Retrieves and updates individual help section content (title, body HTML, related links). Provides the primary read API for rendering help panels in the web UI. |
