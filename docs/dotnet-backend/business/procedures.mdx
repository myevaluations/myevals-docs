# Procedures & Competencies

<!-- Content will be enriched by AI parsing scripts -->

## Overview

The Procedures module tracks trainee competency development through procedure logging, milestone assessments, and Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) tracking. With 30+ classes, this module provides a comprehensive view of a trainee's procedural skills development throughout their training program.

Unlike the Patient Log module (which focuses on encounter recording), the Procedures module centers on competency assessment -- tracking not just what procedures were performed but the trainee's level of competence, supervision requirements, and progression toward independent practice.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Procedure Logging**: Record procedures with supervision level, complexity, outcome, and competency assessment
- **Competency Milestones**: Track ACGME milestone progression across six core competencies and specialty-specific sub-competencies
- **EPA Tracking**: Manage Entrustable Professional Activities with entrustment decisions and progression
- **Minimum Case Requirements**: Enforce specialty board minimum procedure volume requirements
- **Verification Workflow**: Faculty verification and attestation of procedure performance
- **Competency Dashboards**: Visual progression tracking with trend analysis

### ACGME Core Competencies

| Competency | Abbreviation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Patient Care | PC | Clinical skills and patient management |
| Medical Knowledge | MK | Biomedical, clinical, and social sciences |
| Practice-Based Learning | PBLI | Self-assessment and continuous improvement |
| Interpersonal and Communication Skills | ICS | Communication with patients, families, teams |
| Professionalism | PROF | Ethical behavior and commitment to responsibilities |
| Systems-Based Practice | SBP | Healthcare system awareness and resource utilization |
