# System-Wide Migration Status

This page provides a holistic view of the MyEvaluations platform migration from legacy systems to modern technologies. The migration spans three major workstreams:

1. **Backend**: .NET WebForms to Node.js (NestJS)
2. **Frontend**: ASP.NET WebForms pages to React (Next.js + Plasmic)
3. **Background Jobs**: Windows Services (74 schedulers) to BullMQ workers (29 and growing)

## Migration Principles

1. **New features are Node.js + PostgreSQL only** -- No new code in the .NET backend
2. **.NET gets bug fixes only** -- Critical fixes are still applied to the legacy codebase
3. **Shared MSSQL is the bridge** -- Both backends read/write the same SQL Server database
4. **Page-by-page UI migration** -- React HTML partials replace individual WebForms pages
5. **Worker-by-worker job migration** -- BullMQ workers replace Windows Services one at a time

## How to Read This Page

- **Shared** means both systems handle the functionality and will coexist indefinitely (e.g., auth)
- **Largely Migrated** means Node.js handles most traffic but .NET still has some paths
- **In Progress** means active development is happening on the Node.js replacement
- **Planned** means the migration is scoped but development has not started
- **Not Started** means no migration plan exists yet
