## After Onboarding

Once you've completed the above, these resources will help you day-to-day:

| Task | Resource |
|------|----------|
| Fix a bug in a feature you don't know | [Feature → Code Map](./dotnet-backend/feature-map) |
| Understand blast radius before changing shared code | [Module Health Dashboard](./dotnet-backend/module-health) |
| Find a specific file's purpose | [File Reference Index](./dotnet-backend/file-index) |
| Understand a stored procedure chain | [Stored Procedures](./dotnet-backend/data-access/stored-procedures) |
| Plan a migration | [Evaluations Runbook](./dotnet-backend/migration/evaluations-runbook) as a template |
| Check Node.js backend | [Node.js Backend](./nodejs-backend/overview) |
| Explore database tables | [Database Schema Explorer](./database/overview) |

## Platform Context

**What we do:** Healthcare education management — residency training (GME), continuing medical education (CME), nursing and PA programs.

**Who uses it:** Program coordinators, residents/trainees, attending physicians, administrators, accreditation bodies.

**Why it matters:** ACGME accreditation compliance, resident milestone tracking, and evaluation data directly affect residency programs. Downtime or data errors have real consequences for hospitals and physicians.

**The migration:** We're progressively replacing the 25-year-old .NET WebForms monolith with NestJS + React using the strangler fig pattern. New features go in Node.js. Old features get migrated as pages are rewritten in React/Plasmic.
