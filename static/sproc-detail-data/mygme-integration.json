It serves as a lightweight request-logging hook for MyGME program history operations.","businessPurpose":"Provides an audit trail for MyGME program history requests within the MyEvaluations platform. When a user (or process) triggers a program history lookup through the MyGME integration, this SP records who made the request, under which session, and against which object, enabling traceability and debugging of GME (Graduate Medical Education) program history data access.","optimizationRecommendations":["Remove SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED — it has no effect on a pure INSERT statement and is misleading to future maintainers; READ UNCOMMITTED only influences SELECT reads.","Consider wrapping the INSERT in a TRY/CATCH block and suppressing trace failures silently (e.g., logging to an error table instead of surfacing exceptions) so that a tracing failure never blocks the calling application.","If UserIDs is a delimited string of multiple IDs, consider normalizing it into a child table or using a JSON/XML column to allow efficient querying by individual user. A single NVARCHAR column of concatenated IDs is not queryable without string parsing.","Ensure MyGME_ProgramHistoryRequestTrace has an index on CreatedDate (and optionally SessionID) to support time-range queries and session-based lookups against what could become a high-volume trace table."],"migrationRelevance":"low"}]}
